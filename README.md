Compiler generating LLVM code based on the custom language definition. Parser and Scanner generated with the use of GardensPoint tools.

This repository consist the implementation of a compiler for a custom programming language. The definition of the language can be found in CompilerProject/kompilator.lex (definitions of the language symbols) and CompilerProject/kompilator.y (productions of the language).
